    <summary>Archiving and restoring emails from IMAP mailboxes</summary>


    <description><p>  A program to read IMAP accounts and later filter them.
  
  Emails are processed with attachments (complete mime-message) and read from IMAP accounts and stored 
  in a SQLite database (in the future others). Parallelization possible.
  
  What has already been read out once will not be read out again. Ergo one-way synchronization.
  
  A filter view allows to search for criteria in a cheapskate-like way. IMAP folders are mapped by properties.
  Write back to IMAP accounts is also possible. So an IMAP account can be added as it was filtered by criteria using a database.
  
  Thus suitable as a backup.</p></description>
