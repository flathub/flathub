  <description>
    <p>
      Monero is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency.
      You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your
      transfers unless you allow them to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privacy: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to
      send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed
      on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This
      ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain private
      by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus
      network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured.
      Individual wallets have a 25-word mnemonic seed that is only displayed
      once and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files should
      be encrypted with a strong passphrase to ensure they are useless if
      ever stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special
      property of a certain type of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that
      transactions are not only untraceable but have an optional measure of
      ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an
      individual user or computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decentralization: The utility of Monero depends on its decentralised
      peer-to-peer consensus network - anyone should be able to run the monero
      software, validate the integrity of the blockchain, and participate in
      all aspects of the monero network using consumer-grade commodity hardware.
      Decentralization of the monero network is maintained by software
      development that minimizes the costs of running the monero software and
      inhibits the proliferation of specialized, non-commodity hardware.
