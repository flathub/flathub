  <p>Get connected

  If you are in a country where Tor is blocked, you can configure Tor to connect to a bridge during the setup process.

  Select "Tor is censored in my country."

  If Tor is not censored, one of the most common reasons Tor won't connect is an incorrect system clock. Please make sure it's set correctly.

  <p>
  Stay safe

  Please do not torrent over Tor.
  Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address.

  We do not recommend installing additional add-ons or plugins into Tor Browser

  Plugins or addons may bypass Tor or compromise your privacy. Tor Browser already comes with HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript, and other patches to protect your privacy and security.
