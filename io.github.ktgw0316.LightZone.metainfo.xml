    <p>
      LightZone is a professional-level digital darkroom and photo
      editor for Mac, Windows, and Linux. It includes RAW processing
      and editing. Rather than using layers in the way that other
      photo editors do, LightZone lets the user build up a stack of
      tools which can be rearranged, readjusted, turned off and on,
      and removed from the stack. It's a completely non-destructive
      editor, where any of the tools can be re-adjusted or modified
      later â€” even in a different editing session. A tool stack can
      even be copied to a batch of photos at one time. LightZone
      always operates in a 16-bit linear color space with the wide
      gamut of ProPhoto RGB.
