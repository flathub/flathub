    <p>
      NEST Desktop is a web-based application which provides a graphical user interface for NEST Simulator. With this
      easy-to-use tool, users can interactively construct neuronal networks and explore network dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advanced users often choose NEST Simulator: a prominent tool for spiking neuronal networks to measure network
      dynamics.However, programming knowledge is required to write code for this tool. NEST Desktop bypasses this
      requirement, but still teaches users how to construct and explore neuronal networks. A textual script is generated
      from the constructed networks and sent to NEST Simulator; the network activity is then visualized in a graph or
      table. It is a useful teaching tool, since the network graphs and network activity visualizations can be exported
      to files that users can implement for their course protocol.
