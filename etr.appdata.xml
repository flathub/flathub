        <p>
            Extreme Tux Racer is a downhill racing game starring Tux, the Linux
            penguin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tux must slide on his belly down snow and ice covered hills,
            collecting herring, and making it to the finish line before the
            time is up.
        </p>
        <p>
            ETR is based on PlanetPenguin Racer, which is in turn based on the
            famous Tux Racer.
