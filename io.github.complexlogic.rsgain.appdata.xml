    <p>
        rsgain (really simple gain) is a ReplayGain 2.0 command line utility for Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD. 
        rsgain applies loudness metadata tags to your files, while leaving the audio stream untouched. 
        A ReplayGain-compatible player will dynamically adjust the volume of your tagged files during playback.

    <p>
        rsgain is designed with a "batteries included" philosophy, allowing a user to scan their entire music library 
        without requiring external scripts or other tools. It aims to strike the perfect balance between power and simplicity 
        by providing multiple user interfaces.
