  <summary>Cross-platform ncurses Spotify client written in Rust</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      ncspot is a ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using
      librespot. It is heavily inspired by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple and resource friendly alternative to the official client,
      which also supports platforms that currently don't have a Spotify client,
      such as the *BSDs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that ncspot offers features that are legally incompatible with
      free Spotify accounts.
      You must have an existing premium Spotify subscription to use ncspot.
