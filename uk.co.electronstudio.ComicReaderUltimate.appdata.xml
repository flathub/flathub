    <summary>An opinionated CBZ viewer</summary>
    <description>
        <p>ComicReaderUltimate (CRU) is the modern successor to ComicReaderPro, one of the earliest programs for reading comics in CBR, CBZ or JPEG format on Windows, Mac and Linux.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multi-threaded for fast loading</li>
            <li>GPU accelerated rendering</li>
            <li>View single or double pages</li>
            <li>View pages separately or in a continuous scro</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CRU is highly configurable - you can tweak values to find the most natural reading experience.
        However, it is also highly *opinionated*.  It always runs fullscreen because that is the best
        way to read comics.  There is limited GUI because you are expected to learn the mouse or
        keyboard controls.  There is no library browser because your operating system should already
        have file manager.</p>
        <p>CRU is optimized to be as fast and responsive as possible on modern systems without worrying if it will run on legacy hardware.
        This comes at the cost of memory usage - it is assumed you have at least 4GB of RAM and a modern GPU with 2GB of VRAM.
        (CRU makes some effort to optimize for battery power but performance comes first.)</p>
