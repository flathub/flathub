    <p>Salut à Toi is a multi-purpose communication ecosystem.</p>
    <p>It offers many tools to communicate and collaborate (instant messaging, blogging, file sharing, photos albums, forums, events, etc.).
        It is multi-purposes, but also multi-frontends (you can use it on desktop, mobile devices, web browser, or terminal) and multi-platforms.</p>
    <p>Salut à Toi (SàT) is made with a strong sense of ethics (see social contract), is decentralized (you can run your own service, keep your important data yourself, while still being able to communicate with the rest of the network), and use a standard communication protocol (XMPP), making it compatible with many other software.</p>
    <p>This part is the Command Line Interface frontend. You can use it to work with any XMPP based service, do scripts, etc. A REPL shell is included.</p>
