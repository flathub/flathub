        <p>
            Bforartists is a fork of the popular open source 3D software Blender.
            Developed by some 3D enthusiasts to make Blender even better.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bforartists is a complete, free and open source 3D suite to create CG
            content. It offers you the full 3D art pipeline to create game graphics,
            pre-rendered movies and stills. From modeling, sculpting, texturing,
            rigging, animation, rendering, up to post processing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The primary goal of the Bforartists fork is to deliver a refined
            graphical UI and a better usability. This means a complete switch
            in the usage philosophy away from the hotkey centered usage towards
            a user friendly and intuitive graphical UI.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bforartists is fully compatible with the Blender files and addons.
            Every feature that works in Blender should also work in Bforartists.
            Also, every release is always up to date with the newest Blender version.
            The toolset is the same. Where we differ the most is the GUI and the
            handling.
