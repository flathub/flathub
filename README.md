Flatpak manifest for SDL Sopwith
--------------------------------

I played this game with my dad three decades ago!!

Known issues:

- [x] Needs a desktop file
- [ ] Needs a (flathub-compliant) icon
- [ ] Needs AppStream metainfo
- [ ] [Close button on titlebar does not close the game](https://github.com/fragglet/sdl-sopwith/issues/5). In fact I can't figure out how to quit at all!
