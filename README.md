  Comprehensive logging captures extensive data for diagnostics and auditing. Includes a powerful log viewer with search and truncation capabilities, plus options to enable/disable logging for optimal performance.

- **Rich Messaging & File Sharing:**  
  Send plain or encrypted messages, share emojis via a dedicated emoji class, and transfer files seamlessly. Files placed in `~/Documents/Selene/www` can be shared via an ephemeral onion HTTP server, with the onion URL easily accessible from the toolbar. Direct file sharing in chat is supported via file dialog, with automatic secure link generation for recipients.

- **Per-Peer Encryption Control:**  
  Enable or disable additional encryption for each peer using a simple checkbox, tailoring security to your needs.

- **Factory Reset:**  
  Restore the app to its original state with a single action. All data is wiped except for contacts and shared files stored in `~/Documents/Selene`.

- **Quick Access Toolbar:**  
  Convenient toolbar buttons allow instant copying of your chat onion, HTTP onion, and shared directory paths to the clipboard.

- **Chat History Management:**  
  Easily clear chat messages and history per peer or for all peers. Optionally enable automatic history cleaning at app startup for enhanced privacy.

- **Password Protection at Startup:**  
  Enhance your privacy with optional password protection. When enabled, Selene requires a master password at startup to access your data. The system supports secure password creation, change, and validation, with robust SHA-256 hashing and salting. After multiple failed attempts, users can choose to exit or perform a factory reset. Password protection can be enabled or disabled at any time for flexible security management.
