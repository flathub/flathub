# Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered

This is a Flatpak repository for [Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered](https://www.fhs.sh/projects) — a fan-made 
modernization of classic visual novel.

## Accessible to All

KS:RE offers a battery of accessibility features to accommodate players with disabilities. Using the tools available 
in modern Ren’Py, we’ve added quick access to self-voicing, two dyslexic typefaces, a special high contrast text box, 
and various optimizations to improve functionality with common screenreaders - and that’s just the beginning. We’re 
already looking into other ways to make KS:RE even more accessible.

## Fully Transparent
Open source. No archives. No obfuscation. KS:RE doesn’t try to hide how it works. Anyone is welcome to peek under the hood 
and experiment, free of interference. The vastly simplified codebase of KS:RE allows developers of all skill levels to read,
learn, and alter to their heart’s content. If you have an idea- a new accessibility feature, an improvement to a menu, a 
further simplification of the code- you have everything you need to make it happen. KS:RE is a community project first and 
foremost. If you can make the game better, our door is always open.

##  Bells and Whistles
KS:RE, under its default settings, plays exactly as you remember it. However, you have a few new options at your fingertips 
to tailor your experience to your liking. For a touch of visual flair, you can enable Parallax viewing, breathing a little 
extra life into your favorite characters. Sharing your experience has never been simpler- KS:RE seamlessly integrates with 
Discord’s activity bar, letting your friends see your excellent taste in visual novels. All of these features are completely 
optional, and can be toggled with a single click.

## The Complete Package
KS:RE comes preloaded with Russian and French translations, ready to use with no extra effort on the player’s end. Every other 
official translation won’t be far behind. The simplified codebase of KS:RE makes creating new translations easier than ever, 
requiring virtually zero programming knowledge. We’re more than willing to port over any finished translation you create and 
add it to KS:RE- credited to you, of course.
