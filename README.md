Notes:

* The cwebp binary comes from the org.freedesktop.Platform runtime.  If a more specific version is needed, it could be included/built as a module instead.
* oxipng-sources.json comes from the Cargo.lock file from the relevant release of oxipng, passed through https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/blob/master/cargo/flatpak-cargo-generator.py
