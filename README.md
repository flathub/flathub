=====================================================================

Radio is a Free Software program that allows you to easily
locate and listen to Free Internet Radio stations by broadcasters on
the Internet with the help of map and text search.

Radio is developed on the GNOME desktop platform with GNOME
Maps, libchamplain and geocode-lib and it requires gstreamer 1.0 for
audio playback.

You can view all the stations in src/gnome-radio.xml and enter city
names in the GUI search input field in order to locate radio stations
in the city using the text search with auto-completion or click on one
of the city marker in the map to listen to a station.

To launch the program, you can click on Activities in GNOME and enter

   gnome-radio

in the Search field or launch

   gnome-radio

from gnome-terminal.

You can download pre-compiled binaries for Debian GNU/Linux i386,
