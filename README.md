# Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered

This is a Flatpak repository for [Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered](https://www.fhs.sh/projects) — a fan-made
modernization of classic visual novel.

## Accessible to All

KS:RE offers a battery of accessibility features to accommodate players with disabilities. Using the tools available in
modern Ren’Py, we’ve added quick access to self-voicing, two dyslexic typefaces, a special high contrast text box, and
various optimizations to improve functionality with common screenreaders — and that’s just the beginning. We’re already
looking into other ways to make KS:RE even more accessible.

## Fully Transparent

Open source. No archives. No obfuscation. KS:RE doesn’t try to hide how it works. Anyone is welcome to peek under the
hood and experiment, free of interference. The vastly simplified codebase of KS:RE allows developers of all skill levels
to read, learn, and alter to their heart’s content. If you have an idea — a new accessibility feature, an improvement to
a menu, a further simplification of the code- you have everything you need to make it happen. KS:RE is a community
project first and foremost. If you can make the game better, our door is always open.

## Bells and Whistles

KS:RE, under its default settings, plays exactly as you remember it. However, you have a few new options at your
fingertips to tailor your experience to your liking. For a touch of visual flair, you can enable Parallax viewing,
breathing a little extra life into your favorite characters. Sharing your experience has never been simpler — KS:RE
seamlessly integrates with Discord’s activity bar, letting your friends see your excellent taste in visual novels. All
of these features are completely optional, and can be toggled with a single click.

## The Complete Package

KS:RE comes preloaded with Russian, French, Spanish translations, ready to use with no extra effort on the player’s end.
Every other official translation won’t be far behind. The simplified codebase of KS:RE makes creating new translations
easier than ever, requiring virtually zero programming knowledge. We’re more than willing to port over any finished
translation you create and add it to KS:RE — credited to you, of course.

## Mod to your heart’s content

We've been hard at work on designing a simple a modding API for KS:RE, allowing you to create your own mods for the game. Folks are already working on mods for KS:RE, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!

Note: mods support in flatpak version of the game is untested.
