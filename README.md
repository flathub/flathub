# notes
Here are my notes that I've been keeping in order to test this build locally. Sadly since I'm on tauri v1 it means we have to compile webkitgtk-4.0 from source which tags a LOONG time.

It's not even feasable to allow me to test via a github action so I'm using my gaming laptop+WSL.

Running the build in WSL:
```
flatpak-builder \
  --repo=repo \
  --disable-rofiles-fuse \
  --install-deps-from=flathub \
  --force-clean \
  --default-branch=master \
  --arch=x86_64 --ccache \
  build-dir/ dev.overlayed.Overlayed.yaml
```

Running the app via [WSLG](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg)

### WSL Gotcha

When first trying to compile it I ran out of memory so I had to add this to my `%USERPROFILE%/.wslconfig`

```
# Settings apply across all Linux distros running on WSL 2
[wsl2]

# Limits VM memory to use no more than 4 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
memory=20GB 

# Sets the VM to use two virtual processors
processors=8

# Sets amount of swap storage space to 8GB, default is 25% of available RAM
swap=8GB
```

It also still took me around an hour to compile ðŸ˜‚.
