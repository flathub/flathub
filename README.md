  What is Lemonade?
  </h1>

**Lemonade is an open source and experimental emulator, that emulates the functionality of a Nintendo 3DS system on operating systems such as Windows, Linux and Android.**

It was started after the _base_, a previous Nintendo 3DS emulator, was discontinued. The Lemonade Project was created to continue the work of _base_, fixing its issues and improving its performance and compatibility.
