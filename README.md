# Enigma

Enigma is a puzzle game inspired by Oxyd on the Atari ST and Rock'n'Roll on the Amiga. The aim of the game is to uncover pairs of oxide stones of the same color. Simple? Yes. Easy? Certainly not! Hidden traps, huge mazes, laser beams and, last but not least, countless complex puzzles block your way to the Oxyd stones.
