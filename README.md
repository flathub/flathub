# Space Station 14

This repo hosts an unofficial flatpak for
[Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.io/), the multiplayer disaster
simulator.

## Building

To build and install this project locally, use `flatpak-builder`:

    flatpak-builder build-dir com.spacestation14.Launcher.yaml --force-clean --repo=repo --install --user

## Creating a release

To update the version of SS14.Launcher, you will need to update the tag specified in `modules/sources/ss14-launcher-git.yaml`, as well as the nuget sources which are generated using `flatpak-dotnet-generator`. To do all of this automatically, use the `update-ss14-version.py` tool, providing the newest release as the first parameter:

    ./tools/update-ss14-version.py v0.13.2

Finally, remember to add information about the new release to `modules/data/com.spacestation14.Launcher.appdata.xml`.
