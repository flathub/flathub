[Icon](https://github.com/cmus/cmus/issues/965) and [desktop file](https://github.com/cmus/cmus/issues/978) not from upstream.

## Current issues
- MPRIS fails with "connection reset by peer" without full session bus permissions
- Left out cdio (No rule to make target 'cd-drive.1', needed by 'all-am'.)
