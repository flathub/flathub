# JAVA JOLT!

**Java Jolt!** is a **point & click adventure game** where your morning caffeine fix is a matter of survival. Play as Rowena Pitifool, a copywriter who must find a way to get her coffee while enduring the relentless jabs of a particularly annoying inner voice.

Explore, combine, and improvise to salvage your day before it descends into chaos.

Keep in mind that this is a very difficult game, but we know you'll find a way (or another).
