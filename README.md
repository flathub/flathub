# Flatpak packaging of Maliit plugin for SailfishOS

Maliit plugin provides interaction with the Sailfish OS keyboard. In addition
to the communication between the keyboard server and plugin, it follows state
of the application (minimized or active) and screen orientation through communication
with [Flatpak Runner](https://github.com/sailfishos-flatpak/flatpak-runner).

This is packaged as a PlatformInputContexts extension for KDE Flatpak Platform.
