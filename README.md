# Scribus Flatpak

This repository hosts unofficial Flatpak manifests for Scribus. A development
and a nightly version is available, with the latter being available pre-built.
You can find the list of known issues [here][0]. Testing & contributions
welcome!

## Installation

You will need Flatpak [installed][1].

You can install the nightly version of Scribus either by clicking on [this link][2],
or using the command line:

    # Install the nightly version
    flatpak install http://drjurf.tk/scribus-flatpak/scribus-nightly.flatpakref

(The development version is no longer available pre-built, it was too
resource-heavy to maintain both versions, but you can still build it yourself.)

You can find the source code on [GitHub][3].
