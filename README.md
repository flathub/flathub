# broken stuff
- launch button doesn't do anything
- ~- no --user flatpaks~
- ~FWUPD backend~
- KNS backend
- kcm_updates
- can't launch kcm_flatpak
- kuserfeedback [See](https://github.com/renner0e/flathub/commit/1c25f82a28e2dcf5fa00a7c9eda23f9513e4ddb5)

- no idea if the fwupd stuff would actually work in practice, I don't know how to test it
