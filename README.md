Flatpak manifest for SDL Sopwith
--------------------------------

I played this game with my dad three decades ago!!

Known issues:

- [x] Needs a desktop file
- [x] Needs a (flathub-compliant) icon
- [x] Needs AppStream metainfo
- [x] Needs screenshots in metainfo!
- [ ] [Close button on titlebar does not close the game](https://github.com/fragglet/sdl-sopwith/issues/5). In fact I can't figure out how to quit at all!
