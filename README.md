# broken stuff
- launch button doesn't do anything
~- no --user flatpaks~
- KNS
- kcm_updates
- can't launch kcm_flatpak 
- kuserfeedback (why I didn't include it)
[See](https://github.com/renner0e/flathub/commit/1c25f82a28e2dcf5fa00a7c9eda23f9513e4ddb5)

- no idea if the fwupd stuff would actually work in practice
