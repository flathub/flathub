# DOMESTIQUE BASTON

**Domestique Baston** is a **versus fighting game** intended to be quite simple to play for casual gamers. No complicated quarter circle forward + A/B or stuff like that...

In order to limit the amount of work for the project, we thought that the idea of a couple fighting would be an excellent reason for us to have only two playable characters (and we certainly don't care about political correctness).

Depending on the time and energy we have after "v1.0" is released, we may add features to the game, but -- and that's the point of the open source thing -- don't wait for us. Feel free to add whatever you want to the game. We'll be thrilled to see what you come up with.
