        <p>
            TeleSculptor is a cross-platform desktop application for photogrammetry.
            It was designed with a focus on aerial video, such as video collected from
            UAVs, and handles geospatial coordinates and can make use of metadata,
            if available, from GPS and IMU sensors. However, the software can also work
            with non-geospatial data and with collections of images instead of metadata.
            TeleSculptor uses Structure-from-Motion techniques to estimate camera
            parameters as well as a sparse set of 3D landmarks.
            It uses Multiview Stereo techniques to estimate dense depth maps on key
            frame and then fuses those depth maps into a consistent surface mesh which
            can be colored from the source imagery.
