    <p>
      GitAhead is a graphical Git client for Windows, Linux and macOS. It features a fast native interface designed to help you understand and manage your source code history.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitAhead was designed by SciTools™, the makers of Understand™. It has all of the features you expect from a commercial quality client, now completely free and open source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git provides a wealth of historical information that, too often, goes unexploited because it&apos;s cumbersome to explore with other tools. We believe that when you understand your history you&apos;ll make better choices today!
