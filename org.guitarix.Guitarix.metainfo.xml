 <summary>A virtual guitar amplifier</summary>
 <description>
   <p>
     Guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running on Jack
     Audio Connection Kit.
   </p>
   <p>
     Guitarix takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would
     do: as a mono-signal from your sound card. The input is processed
     by a main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately
     and deliver a processed stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the
     rack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules including
     stuff from a simple noise gate to brain-slashing modulation f/x
     like flanger, phaser or auto-wah.
   </p>
   <p>
     Your signal is processed with minimum latency. On any properly
     set-up Linux-system you don't have to wait more than 10ms until
     your sound is processed by guitarix.
   </p>

     <description>
       <p>For this release Damien Zammit from ZamAudio has reworked
       our tube emulation.  This improved beside the overall sound,
       the dynamic responses of the different tube simulations.  Be
       aware please, that this may break your existing presets, but,
       we believe that the improvement in sound is it worse to force
       you to readjust your presets to match the new tube sims.</p>
