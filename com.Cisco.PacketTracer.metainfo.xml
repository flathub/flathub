    <p>Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks.</p>
    <p>The software allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.</p>
    <p>Packet Tracer makes use of a drag and drop user interface, allowing users to add and remove simulated network devices as they see fit.</p>
    <p>The software is mainly focused towards Cisco Networking Academy students as an educational tool for helping them learn fundamental CCNA concepts.</p>
