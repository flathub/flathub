  <description>
    <p>Mosh is a remote terminal application that supports intermittent
    connectivity, allows roaming, and provides speculative local echo
    and line editing of user keystrokes.</p>

    <p>It aims to support the typical interactive uses of SSH, plus:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mosh keeps the session alive if the client goes to sleep and
      wakes up later, or temporarily loses its Internet connection.</li>

      <li>Mosh allows the client and server to "roam" and change IP
      addresses, while keeping the connection alive. Unlike SSH, Mosh
      can be used while switching between Wi-Fi networks or from Wi-Fi
      to cellular data to wired Ethernet.</li>

      <li>The Mosh client runs a predictive model of the server's behavior
      in the background and tries to guess intelligently how each
      keystroke will affect the screen state. When it is confident in
      its predictions, it will show them to the user while waiting for
      confirmation from the server. Most typing and uses of the left-
      and right-arrow keys can be echoed immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a result, Mosh is usable on high-latency links, e.g. on a
    cellular data connection or spotty Wi-Fi. In distinction from
    previous attempts at local echo modes in other protocols, Mosh
    works properly with full-screen applications such as emacs, vi,
    alpine, and irssi, and automatically recovers from occasional
    prediction errors within an RTT. On high-latency links, Mosh
    underlines its predictions while they are outstanding and removes
    the underline when they are confirmed by the server.</p>

    <p>Mosh does not support X forwarding or the non-interactive uses of SSH,
    including port forwarding.</p>
