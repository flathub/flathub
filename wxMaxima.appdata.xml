  <summary>A graphical user interface for Maxima, a powerful computer algebra system</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      wxMaxima is a graphical user interface for the computer algebra system Maxima:
      a program that solves mathematical problems by manipulating
      equations (and outputting the resulting formula), instead of just
      calculating a number. wxMaxima eases the use of Maxima by making
      most of its commands available through a menu system and by
      providing input dialogs for commands that require more than one
      argument. It also implements its own display engine that outputs
      mathematical symbols directly instead of depicting them with
      ASCII characters. 
    </p>
    <p>
      wxMaxima also features 2D and 3D inline plots, simple animations,
      mixing of text and mathematical calculations to create documents,
      exporting of input and output to TeX, document structuring and a
      browser for Maxima's manual including command index and full text
      searching.

          <li>Made entering uppercase greek letters easier and documented how to input special unicode symbols</li>
          <li>Syntax highlighting in code cells</li>
          <li>Automatic highlighting of text equal to the currrently selected one.</li>
          <li>A batch mode that pauses evaluation if Maxima asks a question.</li>
          <li>A "halt on error" feature</li>
          <li>Now evaluation of a new command is only triggered if evaluation of the last command has finished. This means that output from Maxima is always appended to the right cell.</li>
          <li>Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per cell. Sincewe now send Maxima's input command-per-command this means a cell with multiple commands is no more evaluated faster than multiple cells with single commands each.</li>
          <li>If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new "trigger evaluation" menu entry in the Maxima menu.</li>
          <li>On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant that is based on the surprisingly powerful autocompletion feature.</li>
          <li>Ctrl+Tab now launches the autocompletion (or content assistant, if available)</li>
          <li>Tab and Shift+Tab now indent and unindent regions.</li>
          <li>Ctrl+Mouse wheel and Ctrl++/- now zoom in and out of the worksheet.</li>
          <li>Allow Extending selection from part of a single cell to multiple cells.</li>
          <li>A Autoindent functionality.</li>
        </ul>
