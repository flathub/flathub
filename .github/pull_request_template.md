## Please confirm your submission meets all the criteria ##

I have read the guidelines at 
https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Requirements and https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Maintenance and this PR follows the instructions at https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Submission

I am using only the minimal set of permissions. If not, the reasons the application needs each permission are:

All content stored in the flathub is redistributible by any party. If not, the unredistributable parts are using an extra-data source type.

I am an upstream contributor to the project. If not I link to a request for upstream to submit their software to Flathub directly.

I own the domain used in the application id or the domain has a policy for delegating subdomains (e.g. GitHub, SourceForge).

Any additional patches or files have been submitted to the upstream projects concerned. If not, explain why.
