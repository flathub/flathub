      RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

    <p>
      I developed this project as a personal challenge at the age of 18. My goal was to create a high-performance tool for my own photography workflow while deepening my understanding of both React and Rust, with the support from Google Gemini.

        <ul>
          <li>LUTs</li>
            You can now apply LUTs directly to your images, with support for .cube, .3dl, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, and .tiff files. This makes it easy to add color grading or use a LUT as a creative starting point.
          <li>Estimated File Size</li>
            Before exporting, you’ll now see an estimated file size, helping you balance image quality with file size for the best results.
