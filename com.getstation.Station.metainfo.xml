    <p>
      Station was designed with a single purpose in mind: to improve your workflow, 
      a goal that is met by changing the standard browser-based workspace. 
      To be more specific, Station can place a variety of web applications under the 
      same roof, making it easier for you to switch between the apps you use on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Station centralizes all your web tools into a single interface, eliminating 
      the time needed to commute between different browser tabs or desktop apps. 
      Having all the web apps you frequently use in a single place makes it easy 
      for you to work with a large number of programs.
