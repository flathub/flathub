The Nextcloud desktop client allows you to keep one or more folders full of
your photos, videos and documents synchronized with your server. Any file you
add, modify or delete in the synced folders on your desktop or laptop will show
up, change or disappear on the server and all other connected devices. Thanks
to the client, you can work with your files even when you are not online!
