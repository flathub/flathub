Enhancements:
	* Implemented changes requested by Flathub.
		* Used shared modules for libGLU and SDL1.2
		* Tied up Manifest file.
		* Changed download of Savage XR installed to Flatpak install stage (via extra-data section in Manifest), updated bootstrapsavagexr.sh to reflect this.
		* Removed nano text editor (I thought it would be usefful for editing savage config files)
