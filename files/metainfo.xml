    <p>
      ClashCross is a proxy debugging application built on the Clash core. We do not provide any services for it, so please refrain from giving feedback on any issues not related to the application&apos;s own usage. This is an all-in-one network assistant! It can provide you with secure local HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS servers, ensuring the safety of your authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that&apos;s not all, it also supports protocols like VMess, Shadowsocks, Trojan, Snell, and more. This means you can easily connect remotely to various servers, no matter which protocol you need!
    </p>
    <p>
      It doesn&apos;t stop at just connections. This tool comes with a built-in DNS server, which minimizes the impact of DNS pollution attacks and supports DoH/DoT upstream and fake IP functionality, making your network even more secure and reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And wait, there&apos;s more! You can set up rules based on domains, GEOIP, IPCIDR, or processes, enabling intelligent packet forwarding to different nodes for more efficient network traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if you need further customization, you can use remote groups to implement powerful rules such as automatic fallback, load balancing, or even automatic node selection based on closing latencyâ€”everything you need!
    </p>
    <p>
      There&apos;s still more to come! Say goodbye to hardcoding node lists in configurations, as this tool supports remote providers, allowing you to effortlessly fetch node lists remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
      For added convenience in deployment, it also supports Netfilter TCP redirection, making it easy to deploy Clash on your Internet gateway using iptables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, it even offers a comprehensive HTTP RESTful API controller, allowing you to control various functions through APIs. It&apos;s incredibly powerful!
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, this all-around network assistant provides full functionality, helping you establish a secure and efficient network environment. It&apos;s an indispensable and reliable tool for your online life!
    </p>
    <p>To run on Flathub, you must manually set up the system proxy. This is determined by the Flathub mechanism.</p>
