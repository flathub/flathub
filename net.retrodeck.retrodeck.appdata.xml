  <p>
	RetroDECK brings an environment to catalog and play your retro games directly from SteamOS and it's tailored specifically for the Steam Deck.
	It's inspired by embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.</p>
	<p>
	Powered by EmulationStation Desktop Edition, which uses RetroArch and other standalone emulators to allow you to import and play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in a tidy environment without flooding your Steam library.
	No other software is needed as everything it's already included!</p>

        <p><b>Emulators:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>DOLPHIN (SA): Fixed a bug where Dolphin couldn't be properly configured.<br>If it's still misconfigured please run `flatpak run net.retrodeck.retrodeck --reset-sa` in order to reset all the standalone emulators, including Dolphin. </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Backend:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Started manifest trimming, now it's shorten but it may be improved</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Known Issues:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>PCSX2: due to its limitation, the standalone PCSX2 doesn't have any way to set the hotkeys, so no save and load state, no quit button. In order to quit press: STEAM -> PCSX2 -> (X) CLOSE WINDOW, be aware that the state is not automatically saved</li>
          <li>External controllers and keyboard seems not to be working, expecially in the desktop mode</li>
          <li>Yuzu makes RetroDECK freeze in some situations, like if the rom is a bad dump</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>
        At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version they may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.

        </ul>
          <p>Backend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wrapper complete rewrite, now it's faster, tidier, solid</li>
          <li>Wrapper: user data is now backup and moved when managing the internal folders</li>

          <li>Rewrote cooker.yml workflow as the old one was no more useful for the scope</li>

          <li>External controllers seems not to be working</li>
          <li>Yuzu makes RetroDECK freeze in some situations, like if the rom is a bad dump</li>
