      <em> You can fetch a list of videos from your favourite channels on YouTube, Twitch, Odysee and hundreds of other sites (see here or here for a full list) </em> If buffering is an issue, you can download a temporary copy of a video before automatically opening it in your favourite media player <em> Tartube will organise your videos into convenient folders (if that&apos;s what you want) </em> Tartube can alert you when livestreams and debut videos are starting (works on YouTube, Twitch and Odysee by default) <em> If creators upload their videos to more than one website (YouTube and BitChute, for example), Tartube can interact with both sites without creating duplicates </em> Certain sites operate an &quot;only one opinion allowed&quot; policy. If you think that the censors will remove a video, against the wishes of its creators and before you&apos;ve had a chance to watch it, Tartube can make an archive copy <em> Certain sites frequently place restrictions on a video, not because it is unsuitable for some audiences, but for purely political reasons. Tartube can, in some circumstances, see videos that are region-blocked and/or age-restricted </em> Certain sites manipulate search results, repeatedly unsubscribe people from their favourite channels and/or deliberately conceal videos that they don&apos;t like. Tartube won&apos;t do any of those things <em> If you want to listen to your favourite discussion videos, for example while driving a car, Tartube can make an archive copy of just the audio, rather than the full video </em> Tartube is free and open-source software
