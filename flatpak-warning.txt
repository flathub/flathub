| Warning: You are running an unofficial Flatpak version of Visual Studio Code !!! |
|          Visual Studio Code Insiders is also an experimental beta release, and   |
|          not fully tested and stable! Please switch back to the release channel  |
|          if you are experiencing issues with this program.                       |

Please open issues under: https://github.com/flathub/com.visualstudio.code/issues


This version is running inside a container and is therefore not able
to access SDKs on your host system!

To execute commands on the host system, run inside the sandbox:

  $ flatpak-spawn --host <COMMAND>
  
To make the Integrated Terminal automatically use the host system's shell,
you can add this to the settings:

  {
    "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/usr/bin/env",
    "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux": ["--", "flatpak-spawn", "--host", "bash"]
  }

This flatpak provides a standard development environment (gcc, python, etc).
To see what's available:

  $ flatpak run --command=sh com.visualstudio.code
  $ ls /usr/bin (shared runtime)
  $ ls /app/bin (bundled with this flatpak)

To get support for additional languages, you have to install SDK extensions, e.g.

  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.dotnet
  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.golang
  $ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=dotnet,golang flatpak run com.visualstudio.code

You can use

  $ flatpak search <TEXT>

to find others.
