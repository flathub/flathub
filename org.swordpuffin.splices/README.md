# Splices

A word building game made with GTK4 and Python.

The game will be pushed to Flathub soon.

***UNLESS I GET A REASON TO, THIS GAME WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR LINUX***

# How To Play

There are three modes: normal, free play, and free play with timer. The goal in normal mode is to maximise the length of the words available given a limited number of guesses. Free play has no maximum word count but free play with timer has a limited time frame so try to go as fast as possible. 

They can be changed with the game controller icon in the top right

# Keybinds

w - Enter completed word (or not completed word to delete it)

s - Stop or start a game

Ctl-q - Exit

Ctl-? - Show keyboard shortcuts
