    <p>
        Enigma is a unique puzzle game, with influences from almost every game genre. 
        Your objective is easily explained: you control a small black marble with 
        your mouse and have to find and uncover all pairs of identical Oxyd stones in each landscape.
        Simple? Yes.  Easy? It would be, if it weren't for hidden traps, vast mazes,
        insurmountable obstacles and innumerable puzzles blocking your direct way to the Oxyd stones...
        If you like puzzle games and have a steady hand, Enigma's more than 1000 original
        levels will probably keep you busy for hours on end.
