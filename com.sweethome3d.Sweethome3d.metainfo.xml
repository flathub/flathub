      Home 3D is a free interior design application that helps you place your furniture
      on a house 2D plan, with a 3D preview.
    </p>
    <p>
      This program is aimed at people who want to design their interior quickly, whether
      they are moving or they just want to redesign their existing home. Numerous visual
      guides help you draw the plan of your home and layout furniture. You may draw the
      walls of your rooms upon the image of an existing plan, and then, drag and drop
      furniture onto the plan from a catalog organized by categories. Each change in the
      2D plan is simultaneously updated in the 3D view, to show you a realistic rendering
      of your layout.
