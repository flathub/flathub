# Notes:
# - This is a starter manifest for local development and testing. For Flathub submission you should
#   pin a tag or commit (use `tag: vX.Y.Z` or `commit: <sha>`) instead of `branch` and ensure
#   metainfo (AppStream) and icons are present under `data/`.
# - Consider switching to `sdk: org.gnome.Sdk` if you prefer using the GNOME SDK directly.
# - Adjust finish-args to request the minimal set of permissions required by the app. Avoid --filesystem=home
#   for production/bundled builds unless strictly necessary; prefer portals.
