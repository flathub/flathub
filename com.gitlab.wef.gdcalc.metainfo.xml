  <summary>a Financial, Scientific, Statistical &amp; Programming calculator for Unix/Linux (since 1983!)</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      gdcalc is a financial, statistics, scientific and programmers calculator for Unix and Linux.
      The GUI was written with glade(1) and uses the Gtk toolkit - so it may well be compatible with
      themes and other whiz-bang features of those systems.
      gdcalc provides both Algebraic notation (ie. conventional, TI or Casio style) and Reverse
      Polish Notation (RPN or Hewlett-Packard style). If you've not heard of RPN before, you are
      probably familiar with algebraic calculators. Very briefly, while simpler and more natural
      to use, RPN calculators may need some study eg. they have an Enter key instead of the equals
      key and are based on the use of a stack.
