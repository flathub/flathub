      Everything begins here. Organize your requests to reflect your workflow
      or your API data-model. Group and order your API requests to your heart's
      desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define environment variables like authentication credentials, tokens, or
      session IDs for re-use globally or within a public / private environment
      for a seamless development / production workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create, organize, share and execute any REST, SOAP, GraphQL, GRPC
      requests directly from Insomnia without having to switch applications.

      providing you with generated code snippets in popular languages like
      Curl, NodeJS, Go, Swift, Python, Java, C, and more.
