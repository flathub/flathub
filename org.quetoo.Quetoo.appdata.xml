    <p>
      Quetoo is a Free, standalone first person shooter video game based
      on id Tech2. Our goal is to bring the fun of oldschool deathmatch
      to a more contemporary platform, and perhaps to a new generation
      of gamers. Quetoo is multiplayer-only. There is no single-player
      or offline gameplay mode. If you have no Internet and no friends,
      Quetoo might not be for you.
