  <summary>A great 2D soccer (sometimes called football) game</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      It's bringing old style gameplay from DOS times back to the desktop with
      up to date graphics! It's gameplay is similar to old classics such as
      Amco's Kick Off and Sensible Software's Sensible Soccer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gameplay is designed to be quick, responsive and fun. You are always
      in control of the player closest to the ball. The ball is controlled via
      two different kick buttons - one for pass, and one for shoot. Aftertouch
      can be applied to shots by quickly pressing and holding the direction you
      want the ball to bend towards. Pushing in the opposite direction to what
      you kicked the ball makes it raise into the air, pushing in the same
      direction as the ball makes it dip towards the ground.
