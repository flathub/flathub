    publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.
    </p>

    JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files,
    binary distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that you’d like to
    publish as a Git release on popular Git services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea.
    Distribution files may additionally be published to be consumed by popular package managers
