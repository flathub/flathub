    <summary>MIDI sequencer based on classical music notation</summary>
    <description>
    <p>Laborejo (Esperanto: Workshop) is a MIDI sequencer based on classical music notation. Its main purpose is to compose and produce “traditional” music, such as instrumental pieces, soundtracks and other music normally played back by samplers.</p>
    <p>Unlike other notation editors Laborejo is not meant primarily to print out sheets of notation but to create music for your computer: You get all the tools you know from other midi sequencers for maximum fine control to get exactly the music you want!</p>
    <p>Working in Laborejo is very fast and efficient by using a combination of midi input and typing.</p>
