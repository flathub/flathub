  <p>
  Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
  It has been originally created by Dr. Carl Burch and actively developed until 2011.
  After this date the author focused on other projects, and recently the development
  has been officially stopped (see his message here).
</p>
  <p>
  In the meantime, people from a group of swiss institutes (Haute École Spécialisée Bernoise,
  Haute École du paysage, d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Genève,
  and Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud) started developing
  a version of Logisim that fitted their courses, integrating several tools -- for instance
  a chronogram, the possibility to test the schematics directly on an electronic board,
  TCL/TK consoles, ...
</p>
  <p>
  We have decided to release this new Logisim version under the name logisim-evolution,
  to highlight the large number of changes that occurred in these years,
  and we actively seek the contribution of the community.
