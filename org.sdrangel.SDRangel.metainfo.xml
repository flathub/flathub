      It has Native support for Airspy, Airspy HF, Airspy Discovery, FUNcube, HackRF, KiwiSDR, LimeSDR, LimeSDR Mini, LimeRFE, Perseus, PlutoSDR,

    <p>
      Please note that the SDRangel Flatpak requires udev rules for most SDR devices to be installed on the system to work properly.
      You will have to either install the tools for your SDR via regular package manager or manually download the udev rules from
      https://github.com/flathub/org.sdrangel.SDRangel/tree/master/udev-rules and copy them into system /etc/udev/rules.d/
      before using SDRangel.
