  <summary>John the Ripper "Jumbo" password cracker</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
       John the Ripper is a fast password cracker. Its primary purpose is to
       detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash types,
       supported out of the box are Windows LM hashes, plus lots of other hashes
       and ciphers types.

    <release type="stable" version="1.9.0J1" date="2019-04-19" urgency="high">
      <description>
        <p>
          This is a major release (after almost 6 years since the 1.8.0 core
          release), the community's progress in development of jumbo has been so
          much greater that any changes I make to core are relatively small, as is
          core itself.  Yet they are important.  Besides serving as the core for
          jumbo, other uses of this tree include cases where core's functionality
          alone is still sufficient or where (cross-)compiling jumbo for a given
          target system is too difficult or (as a first step in) porting John the
          Ripper to an unusual new platform.
