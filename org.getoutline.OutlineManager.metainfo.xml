        <p>Download the Manager desktop application to begin setting up your server. We designed
            Outline to let you manage everything about your server all in one place. Choose from a
            list of trusted cloud providers, or you can use your own Linux infrastructure. Many
            cloud providers offer plans for $5USD a month or less.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve downloaded the Manager you will be prompted to choose on which cloud provider
            you want to run your server. Choose from some of the most trusted providers like Digital
            Ocean, AWS, or Google Cloud. Once you’ve chosen your cloud provider, they will guide you
            through their specific onboarding process, but you’ll be able to manage your server from
            your Outline Manager.</p>
        <p>Outline allows you to choose where you want your server to be located. Route your traffic
            through Singapore, Germany, or the United States, among many others.</p>
