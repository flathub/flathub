    <description>
        <p>
            <em>DISCLAIMER:</em>This is an early release. The author already uses the software to fulfil own needs, but there's still a room for improvement and a potential to find undiscovered issues, bugs or edge-cases.
        </p>
        <p>Utility facilitating preservation of personal archive of files, replicated in multiple storages of own choice.</p>
        <p>The main focus is on preservation - keep identical copies while not performing any destructive operations, nor replication of corruption, nor other means of data loss.</p>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plain files - archived files aren't wrapped in custom format, and are readable with any application.</li>
            <li>Incremental synchronization - update offline and other storages incrementally, when they become available.</li>
            <li>Filesystem agnostic</li>
        </ul>
