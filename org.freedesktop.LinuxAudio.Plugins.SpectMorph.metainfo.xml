        SpectMorph allows to analyze samples of musical instruments,
        and to combine them (morphing). It can be used to construct
        hybrid sounds, for instance a sound between a trumpet and a
        flute; or smooth transitions, for instance a sound that starts
        as a trumpet and then gradually changes to a flute. In its
        current version, SpectMorph ships with many ready-to-use
        instruments which can be combined using morphing.
