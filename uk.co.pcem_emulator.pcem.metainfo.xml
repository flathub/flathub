            PCem is an emulator for various classic IBM PC clones. It supports various models of PCs,

            To use PCem you will need to dump BIOS ROMs for each machine you want to emulate
            and place them in ~/.var/app/uk.co.pcem_emulator.pcem/.pcem/roms/.

        <p>
            This version of PCem is sandboxed. You have to copy all the files to your
