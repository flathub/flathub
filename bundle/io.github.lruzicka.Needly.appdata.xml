    <p>
        Needly is a simple editor that helps when developing tests that can be run in the openQA automated test tool that is used by SuSE and Fedora to test their GUI of their operating systems. To control those tests, operators need to bundle a screenshot with certain metadata (a needle) so that openQA can        utilize it to navigate in tested GUI elements. This editor is an independent tool (no openQA installation needed) that reasonably simplifies the needle        creation process thus making it easier for people to start with openQA test development.
