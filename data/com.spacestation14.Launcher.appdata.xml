            Space Station 14 tells the story of an ordinary shift on a space
            station gone wrong. Immerse yourself into your role, tinker with
            detailed systems, and survive the chaos in this round-based
            multiplayer role playing game.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Your custom character can spawn as one of dozens of crew and enemy
            jobs, ranging from engineer to captain, or even a traitor, each
            with its own unique gear. Your duties guide you through rich
            interactions with complex mechanics, whether you're managing your
            inventory, setting up the reactor, or flushing yourself down the
            disposal tubes.
        </p>

        <p>
            As disaster, incompetence, and sabotage strike the station, the
            tension rises - opening up emergent situations that force you to
            make hard choices. Will you patch up the medical bay after an
            asteroid punches a hole in it, or fight for control when the
            captain gets murdered by revolutionaries? Do you break out an
            unjustly imprisoned clown, or sit back at the bar and serve drinks
            without a care in the world?
        </p>

        <p>
            The story of the station's collapse is in the hands of its
            players, and each round is an intense, immersive experience that
            will leave you wanting more.
        </p>
