Qutebrowser Flatpak
===================

This flatpak is based on the KDE platform version 5.10 and ships all
additional dependecies of qutebrowser.

Builing the flatpak
-------------------

To install the SDK system wide run:

 sudo flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//1.6
 sudo flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk//1.6
 sudo flatpak install flathub org.kde.Platform//5.10
 sudo flatpak install flathub org.kde.Sdk//5.10

To actually build the flatpak run the following command:

 flatpak-builder --force-clean app-dir org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.json

To run the flatpak from current build:

 flatpak-builder --run app-dir org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.json qutebrowser

Installing from a local repository
----------------------------------

You need at least version 0.9.1 of flatpak to build the system, e.g. from
Debian backports.

Export the flatpak application to a local repository:

 flatpak build-export repo app-dir

Add the local repository to your flatpak system (only required once):

 flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify --if-not-exists qutebrowser-repo repo

Install the flatpak from your local repository:

 flatpak --user install qutebrowser-repo org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser

Run the installed flatpak:

 flatpak run org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser

To update the flatpak from your repository run the build-export command after
building once again. Finally execute the following command to perform the
update from your local repo:

 flatpak update org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser

Or

 flatpak update

to update all installed flatpaks.

Sandbox
-------

Your configuration gets read from 
$HOME/.var/app/org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser/config/qutebrowser/

The sandboxed qutebrowser can read all files from your system, but only write
to your XDG downloads folder.

Direct rendering, using the webcam and sound using pulseaudio are allowed.

Known Limitations
-----------------

* Requires access to all devices to support video from webcams

* Sandboxing each tab isn't supported since flatpak doesn't allow nested sandboxes

* ARM isn't supported because of the missing PyQt wheel package

* Only printing to PDF works

* Performance issues, especially on large sites and scrolling
