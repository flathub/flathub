    <p>
      FCast is an open source protocol that enables wireless streaming of audio and video content between devices, supporting various stream types such as DASH, HLS, and mp4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike proprietary protocols like Chromecast and AirPlay, FCast offers an open approach, empowering third-party developers to create their own receiver devices or integrate the FCast protocol into their own apps.
