    <p>
      wfview is a program developed by amateur radio enthusiasts to control modern Icom ham radios. It provides the user with controls
      that may be comfortably operated from a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen interface. wfview is free and open source software.
    </p>
    <p>
      wfview has been developed with an eye towards compatibility. Even though our target platform consists of modern-era transceivers,
      wfview’s command dictionary is focused on commands with the most compatibility. Many of Icom’s transceivers from the last 20 years
      will work to some degree with wfview, and we are always adding more.
