      The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based tactical strategy game with a high
      fantasy theme.
      Build up a great army, gradually turning raw recruits into hardened
      veterans.
      In later games, recall your toughest warriors and form a deadly host whom
      no one can stand against! Choose units from a large pool of specialists,
      and hand-pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on different
      terrains against all manner of opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wesnoth has many different sagas waiting to be played.
      Fight to regain the throne of Wesnoth, of which you are the legitimate
      heir... lead a brutal quest to unite the orcish tribes... vanquish a horde
      of undead warriors... Guide a band of elvish survivors in an epic quest to
      find a new home...
    </p>
    <p>
      There are at least two hundred unit types, sixteen races, six major
      factions, and hundreds of years of history.
      The world of Wesnoth is absolutely huge and only limited by your
      creativity.
      You can also challenge up to eight friends—or strangers—and fight in
      epic multiplayer fantasy battles.
