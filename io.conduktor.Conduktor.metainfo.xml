              <p>Conduktor Alpha was announced a year ago at Kafka Summit London 2019, and at the time, we didn’t know if people would like our idea. There were no good desktop applications for Apache Kafka, and we made this wild &amp; crazy bet of creating one. One year later, we can confidently say that our users love Conduktor… thousands of them!</p>
              <p>
                We are overwhelmed by the positive response and we know how much Conduktor is helping you in your day-to-day development and operations. Conduktor has now matured, and to be able to continuously improve it, we will start offering yearly licenses for Conduktor 2.0. Conduktor 1.0, the version you are currently using, has not evolved for months and will stop working on June 1st.
