 The version of vorbisgain packaged for Debian differs in two ways from
 the upstream version. First, it does not retain the modification time
 of the input file by default: if tags are changed in a file, the mtime will
-change; you can specify "-p" to get the normal behaviour.
+change; you can specify "\-p" to get the normal behaviour.
 Second, it does not try to process wildcards in filenames. This makes
 it impossible to say "process all foo*.ogg in all subdirectories", but
 also avoids problems with filenames that actually contain wildcards.
