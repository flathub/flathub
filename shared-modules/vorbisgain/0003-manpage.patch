 Calculate the album gain and peak, in addition to the track gain and peak, for
 all .ogg files in the directory "music" (and all subdirectories). All files in
 one directory are treated as belonging to the same album. Files that already
 have ReplayGain tags are not re-calculated. Note the quotes, as they cause the
 shell to not do any filename globbing:

 Gain specifies how much the volume should be changed before playback, in dB.
 Peak is the maximum sample value of the file before any gain has been
 applied, where 1.0 means "full sample value" (32,767 when decoding to signed

+.SH NOTE
+The version of vorbisgain packaged for Debian differs in two ways from
+the upstream version. First, it does not retain the modification time
+of the input file: if tags are changed in a file, the mtime will change.
+Second, it does not try to process wildcards in filenames. This makes
+it impossible to say "process all foo*.ogg in all subdirectories", but
+also avoids problems with filenames that actually contain wildcards.
+Without this change, "vorbisgain *.ogg" in a directory with a file that
+contains a question mark would result in that file being treated as
+being in a different album.
