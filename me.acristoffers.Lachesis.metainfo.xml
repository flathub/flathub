    <p>
      Lachesis is the frontend of the control platform. This application allows you to configure the hardware, execute system response tests and run controllers with an easy to use interface. The used input and output signals, as well as variables, can be seen graphically, updating in real time. It works only as a frontend, meaning that all data is stored and managed in/by the moirai server. The server is also responsible for executing the controller. That means that you can install moirai in a dedicated computer, like a Raspberry Pi, and Lachesis in another one, using Lachesis like a remote control for your control system. This allows various user to share plant configuration.
