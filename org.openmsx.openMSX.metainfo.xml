		<p>
			openMSX is an emulator for the MSX home computer system. MSX is an old
			Z80-based family of home computers as an attempt to establish
			a single standard in home computing similar to VHS in video.
		</p>
		<p>
			The MSX standard has been designed by a company called ASCII in cooperation
			with Microsoft which has provided a firmware version of its extended BASIC
			(called "MicroSoft eXtended BASIC") for the machine, which explains the
			MSX name.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to emulating MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, MSX Turbo R and many of it's
			peripherals, openMSX also supports emulating the ColecoVision game console
			and the SpectraVideo SVI-318 and SVI-328 home computer systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: by default the openMSX emulator only ships with the C-BIOS open-source
			BIOS implementation. This BIOS is restricted to cartridge based MSX games. For
			a full MSX or SVI emulation it is necessary to provide your own MSX and/or SVI
			BIOS ROMs, which must be placed in the ~/.openMSX/share/systemroms directory.
		</p>
