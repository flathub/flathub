    <p>
      Jan is a ChatGPT-alternative that runs 100% offline on your device. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to download and run LLMs and use AI with full control and privacy.
    </p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Local AI Models: Download and run large language models like Llama, Gemma, and Qwen directly from Hugging Face. All models run locally on your device.</li>
      <li>Cloud Integration: Connect to cloud providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Groq when needed. Easily switch between local and cloud models</li>
      <li>Custom Assistants: Set up specialized AI assistants for different tasks, such as writing, summarizing, or coding. Customize their tone and behavior.</li>
      <li> OpenAI-Compatible API: Jan includes a local API server (localhost:1337) that works with tools and plugins expecting OpenAIâ€™s API format.</li>
      <li>Model Context Protocol (MCP): Supports MCP to improve context handling and interactions across larger or more complex tasks.</li>
      <li>Privacy First: Jan runs fully offline by default. Your data never leaves your device unless you enable cloud connections.</li>
    </ul>
