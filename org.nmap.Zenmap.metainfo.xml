  <description>
    <p>Zenmap is the official Nmap Security Scanner GUI. It is a multi-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, etc.) free and open source application which aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while providing advanced features for experienced Nmap users. Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles to make them easy to run repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive creation of Nmap command lines. Scan results can be saved and viewed later. Saved scan results can be compared with one another to see how they differ. The results of recent scans are stored in a searchable database.</p>
    <p>This version of Zenmap has a user restriction due to Flatpak: It can't be run as a root user. For all but some specific cases this package should offer feature parity, but it's important to understand that this is trade-off between security and power.</p>
