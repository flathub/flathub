        <p>Help text is now shown for new players. This is shown on game start in
novice mode, but won't be shown again after a successful flight. The help
text will also appear in other single player modes, but only if it looks
like you're really struggling to get the plane off the ground.</p>
        <p>It's no longer possible to flip the plane upside down while sitting
motionless on the runway (a bug since the original DOS versions).</p>
        <p>It's no longer possible to get wounded on the ground. If a plane shoots
another on the ground, that's a successful raid. This fixes a bug where
a wounded plane on the runway would still be damaged after takeoff.</p>
        <p>The game no longer freezes up in multiplayer mode if the other player
quits. When establishing a connection, a helpful message is shown about how
to abort.</p>
        <p>If the game quits with an error, a friendly dialog box now shows the error.</p>
