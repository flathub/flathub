  Securely Sync Data Across All Your Devices
  Termius lets you organize hosts into groups.
  Groups allow you to share settings, though each host can have its own separate preferences.
  This data, along with connection and command history, is securely synced across all your devices.
  Termius uses end-to-end encryption to ensure your data remains safe and secure.
