   GNU cpio is a tool for creating and extracting archives, or copying
files from one place to another.  It handles a number of cpio formats as
well as reading and writing tar files.  This is the first edition of the
GNU cpio documentation and is consistent with 2.12.

1 Introduction
**************

GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive, The archive
can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.

   GNU cpio supports the following archive formats: binary, old ASCII,
new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar, and POSIX.1 tar.
The tar format is provided for compatibility with the 'tar' program.  By
default, cpio creates binary format archives, for compatibility with
older cpio programs.  When extracting from archives, cpio automatically
recognizes which kind of archive it is reading and can read archives
created on machines with a different byte-order.

2 Tutorial
**********

GNU cpio performs three primary functions.  Copying files to an archive,
Extracting files from an archive, and passing files to another directory
tree.  An archive can be a file on disk, one or more floppy disks, or
one or more tapes.

   When creating an archive, cpio takes the list of files to be
processed from the standard input, and then sends the archive to the
standard output, or to the device defined by the '-F' option.  *Note
Copy-out mode::.  Usually find or ls is used to provide this list to the
standard input.  In the following example you can see the possibilities
for archiving the contents of a single directory.

     % ls | cpio -ov > directory.cpio

   The '-o' option creates the archive, and the '-v' option prints the
names of the files archived as they are added.  Notice that the options
can be put together after a single '-' or can be placed separately on
the command line.  The '>' redirects the cpio output to the file
'directory.cpio'.

   If you wanted to archive an entire directory tree, the find command
can provide the file list to cpio:

     % find . -print -depth | cpio -ov > tree.cpio

   This will take all the files in the current directory, the
directories below and place them in the archive tree.cpio.  Again the
'-o' creates an archive, and the '-v' option shows you the name of the
files as they are archived.  *Note Copy-out mode::.  Using the '.' in
the find statement will give you more flexibility when doing restores,
as it will save file names with a relative path vice a hard wired,
absolute path.  The '-depth' option forces 'find' to print of the
entries in a directory before printing the directory itself.  This
limits the effects of restrictive directory permissions by printing the
directory entries in a directory before the directory name itself.

   Extracting an archive requires a bit more thought because cpio will
not create directories by default.  Another characteristic, is it will
not overwrite existing files unless you tell it to.

     % cpio -iv < directory.cpio

   This will retrieve the files archived in the file directory.cpio and
place them in the present directory.  The '-i' option extracts the
archive and the '-v' shows the file names as they are extracted.  If you
are dealing with an archived directory tree, you need to use the '-d'
option to create directories as necessary, something like:

     % cpio -idv < tree.cpio

   This will take the contents of the archive tree.cpio and extract it
to the current directory.  If you try to extract the files on top of
files of the same name that already exist (and have the same or later
modification time) cpio will not extract the file unless told to do so
by the -u option.  *Note Copy-in mode::.

   In copy-pass mode, cpio copies files from one directory tree to
another, combining the copy-out and copy-in steps without actually using
an archive.  It reads the list of files to copy from the standard input;
the directory into which it will copy them is given as a non-option
argument.  *Note Copy-pass mode::.

     % find . -depth -print0 | cpio --null -pvd new-dir

   The example shows copying the files of the present directory, and
sub-directories to a new directory called new-dir.  Some new options are
the '-print0' available with GNU find, combined with the '--null' option
of cpio.  These two options act together to send file names between find
and cpio, even if special characters are embedded in the file names.
Another is '-p', which tells cpio to pass the files it finds to the
directory 'new-dir'.

3.1 Copy-out mode
=================

In copy-out mode, cpio copies files into an archive.  It reads a list of
filenames, one per line, on the standard input, and writes the archive
onto the standard output.  A typical way to generate the list of
filenames is with the find command; you should give 'find' the '-depth'
option to minimize problems with permissions on directories that are
unreadable.

   Copy-out mode is requested by the '-o' ('--create') command line
option, e.g.:

     % find | cpio -o > directory.cpio

   The following options can be used in copy-out mode:

'-0'
'--null'
     Filenames in the list are delimited by ASCII null characters
     instead of newlines.

     Verbosely list the files processed.
'-V'
'--dot'
     Print a '.' for each file processed.
'-W'

3.2 Copy-in mode
================

In copy-in mode, cpio copies files from an archive into the filesystem
or lists the archive contents.  It reads the archive from the standard
input.  Any non-option command line arguments are shell globbing
patterns; only files in the archive whose names match one or more of
those patterns are copied from the archive.  Unlike in the shell, an
initial '.' in a filename does match a wildcard at the start of a
pattern, and a '/' in a filename can match wildcards.  If no patterns
are given, all files are extracted.

   The copy-in mode is requested by the '-i' ('--extract') command line
option.

   The following options can be used in copy-in mode:

'--absolute-filenames'
     Do not strip file system prefix components from the file names.
'--no-absolute-filenames'
     Create all files relative to the current directory.

3.3 Copy-pass mode
==================

In copy-pass mode, cpio copies files from one directory tree to another,
combining the copy-out and copy-in steps without actually using an
archive.  It reads the list of files to copy from the standard input;
the directory into which it will copy them is given as a non-option
argument.

   This mode is requested by the '-p' ('--pass-through') command line
option.

3.4 Options
===========

This section summarizes all available command line options.  References
in square brackets after each option indicate 'cpio' modes in which this
option is valid.

'-0'
'--null'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Read a list of filenames terminated by a null character, instead of
     a newline, so that files whose names contain newlines can be
     archived.  GNU find is one way to produce a list of null-terminated
     filenames.  This option may be used in copy-out and copy-pass
     modes.

'-a'
'--reset-access-time'
     [*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Reset the access times of files after reading them, so that it does
     not look like they have just been read.

'-A'
'--append'
     [*note copy-out::]
     Append to an existing archive.  Only works in copy-out mode.  The
     archive must be a disk file specified with the '-O' or '-F'
     ('--file') option.

'-b'
'--swap'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Swap both halfwords of words and bytes of halfwords in the data.
     Equivalent to '-sS'.  This option may be used in copy-in mode.  Use
     this option to convert 32-bit integers between big-endian and
     little-endian machines.

'-B'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Set the I/O block size to 5120 bytes.  Initially the block size is
     512 bytes.

'--block-size=BLOCK-SIZE'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Set the I/O block size to BLOCK-SIZE * 512 bytes.

'-c'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Use the old portable (ASCII) archive format.

'-C IO-SIZE'
'--io-size=IO-SIZE'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Set the I/O block size to IO-SIZE bytes.

'-d'
'--make-directories'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-pass::]
     Create leading directories where needed.

'-D DIR'
'--directory=DIR'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Change to the directory DIR before starting the operation.  This
     can be used, for example, to extract an archive contents in a
     different directory:

          $ cpio -i -D /usr/local < archive

     or to copy-pass files from one directory to another:

          $ cpio -D /usr/bin -p /usr/local/bin < filelist

     The '-D' option does not affect file names supplied as arguments to
     another command line options, such as '-F' or '-E'.  For example,
     the following invocation:

          cpio -D /tmp/foo -d -i -F arc

     instructs 'cpio' to open the archive file 'arc' in the current
     working directory, then change to the directory '/tmp/foo' and
     extract files to that directory.  If '/tmp/foo' does not exist, it
     will be created first (the '-d' option) and then changed to.

'-E FILE'
'--pattern-file=FILE'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Read additional patterns specifying filenames to extract or list
     from FILE.  The lines of FILE are treated as if they had been
     non-option arguments to cpio.  This option is used in copy-in mode,

'-f'
'--nonmatching'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Only copy files that do not match any of the given patterns.

'-F ARCHIVE'
'--file=ARCHIVE'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::]
     Archive filename to use instead of standard input or output.  To
     use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename
     that starts with 'HOSTNAME:', where HOSTNAME is the name or IP
     address of the machine.  The hostname can be preceded by a username
     and an '@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you
     have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's
     '~/.rhosts' file).

'--force-local'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::]
     With '-F', '-I', or '-O', take the archive file name to be a local
     file even if it contains a colon, which would ordinarily indicate a
     remote host name.

'-H FORMAT'
'--format=FORMAT'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Use archive format FORMAT.  The valid formats are listed below with
     file size limits for individual files in parentheses; the same
     names are also recognized in all-caps.  The default in copy-in mode
     is to automatically detect the archive format, and in copy-out mode
     is 'bin'.

     'bin'
          The obsolete binary format.  (2147483647 bytes)

     'odc'
          The old (POSIX.1) portable format.  (8589934591 bytes)

     'newc'
          The new (SVR4) portable format, which supports file systems
          having more than 65536 i-nodes.  (4294967295 bytes)

     'crc'
          The new (SVR4) portable format with a checksum added.

     'tar'
          The old tar format.  (8589934591 bytes)

     'ustar'
          The POSIX.1 tar format.  Also recognizes GNU tar archives,
          which are similar but not identical.  (8589934591 bytes)

     'hpbin'
          The obsolete binary format used by HPUX's cpio (which stores
          device files differently).

     'hpodc'
          The portable format used by HPUX's cpio (which stores device
          files differently).

'-i'
'--extract'
     Run in copy-in mode.  *Note Copy-in mode::.

'-I ARCHIVE'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Archive filename to use instead of standard input.  To use a tape
     drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts
     with 'HOSTNAME:', where HOSTNAME is the name or IP address of the
     remote host.  The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@'
     to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have
     permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts'
     file).

'-l'
'--link'
     [*note copy-pass::]
     Link files instead of copying them, when possible.

'-L'
'--dereference'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-pass::]
     Copy the file that a symbolic link points to, rather than the
     symbolic link itself.

'-m'
'--preserve-modification-time'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-pass::]
     Retain previous file modification times when creating files.

'-M MESSAGE'
'--message=MESSAGE'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::]
     Print MESSAGE when the end of a volume of the backup media (such as
     a tape or a floppy disk) is reached, to prompt the user to insert a
     new volume.  If MESSAGE contains the string '%d', it is replaced by
     the current volume number (starting at 1).

'-n'
'--numeric-uid-gid'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Show numeric UID and GID instead of translating them into names
     when using the '--verbose' option.

'--no-absolute-filenames'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::]
     Create all files relative to the current directory in copy-in mode,
     even if they have an absolute file name in the archive.

'--no-preserve-owner'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-pass::]
     Do not change the ownership of the files; leave them owned by the
     user extracting them.  This is the default for non-root users, so
     that users on System V don't inadvertantly give away files.  This
     option can be used in copy-in mode and copy-pass mode

'-o'
'--create'
     Run in copy-out mode.  *Note Copy-out mode::.

'-O ARCHIVE'
     [*note copy-out::]
     Archive filename to use instead of standard output.  To use a tape
     drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts
     with 'HOSTNAME:', where HOSTNAME is the name or IP address of the
     machine.  The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@' to
     access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have permission
     to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts' file).

'--only-verify-crc'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Verify the CRC's of each file in the archive, when reading a CRC
     format archive.  Don't actually extract the files.

'-p'
'--pass-through'
     Run in copy-pass mode.  *Note Copy-pass mode::.

'--quiet'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Do not print the number of blocks copied.

'-r'
'--rename'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Interactively rename files.

'-R OWNER'
'--owner OWNER'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     In copy-in and copy-pass mode, set the ownership of all files
     created to the specified OWNER (this operation is allowed only for
     the super-user).  In copy-out mode, store the supplied owner
     information in the archive.

     The argument can be either the user name or the user name and group
     name, separated by a dot or a colon, or the group name, preceeded
     by a dot or a colon, as shown in the examples below:

          cpio --owner smith
          cpio --owner smith:
          cpio --owner smith:users
          cpio --owner :users

     The argument parts are first looked up in the system user and group
     databases, correspondingly.  If any of them is not found there, it
     is treated as numeric UID or GID, provided that it consists of
     decimal digits only.

     To avoid the lookup and ensure that arguments are treated as
     numeric values, prefix them with a plus sign, e.g.:

          cpio --owner +0
          cpio --owner +0:
          cpio --owner +0:+0
          cpio --owner :+0

     If the group is omitted but the ':' or '.' separator is given, as
     in the second example.  the given user's login group will be used.

'--rsh-command=COMMAND'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Notifies cpio that is should use COMMAND to communicate with remote
     devices.

'-s'
'--swap-bytes'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Swap the bytes of each halfword (pair of bytes) in the files.  This
     option can be used in copy-in mode.

'-S'
'--swap-halfwords'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Swap the halfwords of each word (4 bytes) in the files.  This
     option may be used in copy-in mode.

'--sparse'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-pass::]
     Write files with large blocks of zeros as sparse files.  This
     option is used in copy-in and copy-pass modes.

'-t'
'--list'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Print a table of contents of the input.  Can be used alone, as a
     mode designator, in which case '-i' is implied.

'--to-stdout'
     [*note copy-in::]
     Extract files to standard output.  This option may be used in
     copy-in mode.

'-u'
'--unconditional'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-pass::]
     Replace all files, without asking whether to replace existing newer
     files with older files.

'-v'
'--verbose'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     List the files processed, or with '-t', give an 'ls -l' style table
     of contents listing.  In a verbose table of contents of a ustar
     archive, user and group names in the archive that do not exist on
     the local system are replaced by the names that correspond locally
     to the numeric UID and GID stored in the archive.

'-V'
'--dot'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Print a '.' for each file processed.

'--version'
     Print the cpio program version number and exit.

'-W'
'--warning=FLAG'
     [*note copy-in::,*note copy-out::,*note copy-pass::]
     Control warning display.  The argument is one of the following:

     none
          Disable all warnings.
     all
          Enable all warnings.
     truncate
          Warn about truncation of file header fields.
     no-truncate
          Disable truncation warnings.

4 Magnetic Media
****************

Archives are usually written on removable media-tape cartridges, mag
tapes, or floppy disks.

   The amount of data a tape or disk holds depends not only on its size,
but also on how it is formatted.  A 2400 foot long reel of mag tape
holds 40 megabytes of data when formated at 1600 bits per inch.  The
physically smaller EXABYTE tape cartridge holds 2.3 gigabytes.

   Magnetic media are re-usable-once the archive on a tape is no longer
needed, the archive can be erased and the tape or disk used over.  Media
quality does deteriorate with use, however.  Most tapes or disks should
be disgarded when they begin to produce data errors.

   Magnetic media are written and erased using magnetic fields, and
should be protected from such fields to avoid damage to stored data.
Sticking a floppy disk to a filing cabinet using a magnet is probably
not a good idea.
