    <p>
      Running ponysay -q will print a random pony saying one of its quotes from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. The pony can be specified: ponysay -q pinkie. Just as with -f, -q can be used multiple times to specify a set of ponies from which a single one will be selected randomly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When running ponysay -l or ponysay -L the ponies with quotes will be printed in bold or bright (depending on the used terminal).
