 <summary>Lightweight Bitcoin client</summary>
 <description>
  <p>Main features are:</p>
  <p>- Encrypted wallet: the file that contains bitcoin private keys is protected with a password, and never leaves the user's computer</p>
  <p>- Deterministic key generation: If you lose your wallet file, you can recover it from its seed. You are protected from your own mistakes</p>
  <p>- Instant on: by default the client does not download the blockchain, it requests that information from a server. No delays, always up-to-date</p>
  <p>- Transactions are signed locally: Your private keys are not shared with the server. You do not have to trust the server with your money</p>
  <p>- Cold storage: Keeping private keys offline is supported. Has a watch-only mode for online use</p>
  <p>- Multisignature: Dividing the power to spend coins between multiple wallets is supported</p>
  <p>- Hardware wallet integration: Many leading hardware wallets can interface with Electrum</p>
  <p>- Redundancy: You are not tied to a particular server, and the server does not need to know you. One server going down doesn't cause user downtimes</p>
  <p>- No single point of failure: The server code is open source, anyone can run a server. Private keys can be exported and imported into other wallets</p>
  <p>- Firewall friendly: The client does not need to open a port, it simply polls the server for updates</p>
  <p>- Free software: MIT License. Anyone can audit the code</p>
  <p>- Written in Python. The code is short, and easy to review</p>
  <p>- Add-ons: third-party plugins are supported</p>
  <p>- Support for Bitcoin URIs, signed URIs and Bitcoin aliases.</p>
