# Piveo

Piveo is an application designed to help memorize first and last names — a difficulty frequently encountered by teachers, especially at the beginning of the school year.  
It can also be used in other professional contexts where memorizing people’s names is important.

## Purpose

Piveo helps users associate:

- a first name,
- a last name,
- a photo,
- and additional contextual information.

The application focuses on repetition, visual memory, and active recall.

## Available structures

Piveo can be used in different contexts:

- **School** (students),
- **Business** (employees),
- **Parliament** (members).

Only the vocabulary changes; the interface and logic remain the same.

## Features

- Oral test mode
- Written test mode
- Search mode (by first name or last name)
- Navigation through people
- Optional random order
- Choice between:
  - first name + last name

  - last name only

Photos are displayed to reinforce visual memory.

## Technology

Piveo is developed using:

- Python 3
- PySide6
- SQLite
- Pillow

## Distribution

The application is distributed as an **AppImage**, making it easy to run without installation.

## License
