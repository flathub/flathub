  <summary>A multi-threaded EM tool based on NEC2 to model antenna radiation patterns</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Xnec2c is a high-performance multi-threaded electromagnetic simulation
      package to model antenna near- and far-field radiation patterns for
      Linux and UNIX operating systems. The original FORTRAN version of NEC2
      was ported to C by Neoklis Kyriazis, 5B4AZ and released as nec2c. Later
      he wrote xnec2c, a graphical interface for ease of use with many more
      features.
