      Creates 3D images from photographs taken with an ordinary camera.  Take a set of photos of a subject and the software will create a 3D image from  each pair of photos in the set, so that you can choose the best. Vertical and  rotational alignment of the left and right images is essential for a convincing  3D effect, but difficult to achieve with an ordinary camera. The software  corrects any misalignment (not available with the Flatpak). Formats that can be created are anaglyph (red/cyan),  side-by-side and crossover. Several sets of photos can be processed at once,  they can be previewed and poor ones can be deleted.
